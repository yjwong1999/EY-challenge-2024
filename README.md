# EY-challenge-2024: Tropical storm damage detection model

The goal of the [challenge](https://challenge.ey.com/challenges/tropical-cyclone-damage-assessment-lrrno2xm) is to develop a machine learning model to identify and detect “damaged” and “un-damaged” coastal infrastructure (residential and commercial buildings), which have been impacted by natural calamities such as hurricanes, cyclones, etc. Participants will be given pre- and post-cyclone satellite images of a site impacted by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and build a machine learning model, designed to detect four different objects in a satellite image of a cyclone impacted area:
1. Undamaged residential building
2. Damaged residential building
3. Undamaged commercial building
4. Damaged commercial building

## Our Solution

Our proposed method achived promising results with minimal training data!
- We are among the Top 10 entrants of **EY Open Science Data Challenge 2024** 🎉🥳 </br>
- We ranked 11 out of 222 teams worldwide on the leaderboard (Top 5%) 🌍🏆 </br>
- In terms of evaluation score, we rank 4th, tying with other impressive competing teams! 🤩

## Business Idea: Data Fleet is What You Need
- Data is often compared to oil, but like oil, data needs to be refined and transformed to unleash its true potential.

## Setup environment
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yjwong1999/EY-challenge-2024.git
cd EY-challenge-2024

# Create conda environment
conda create --name ey-challenge python=3.8.10 -y
conda activate ey-challenge
```

## Training
1. Start with `1 BuildingDetection.ipynb` to pretrain a YOLOv8n model using [Msft Building Footprint](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/ms-buildings) dataset. A pretrained experiments outputs (including the weights) of Module 1 are provided in `pretrained` directory. So unless you want to modify the training pipeline for Module 1, you can skip this and directly go to Module 2.
2. With the pretrained model, you can proceed to `2 Finetuner.ipynb`. In this module, you will fine-tune the pretrained model from Module 1 on the EY Training Dataset
